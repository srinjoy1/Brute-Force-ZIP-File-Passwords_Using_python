This Python script is designed to crack passwords of ZIP files using a custom word list. It uses a brute force approach by iterating through each password in the provided list and attempting to extract the contents of the ZIP file. If successful, it prints the password and its line number in the word list. The script is useful for recovering passwords for forgotten ZIP files or for security testing purposes.
